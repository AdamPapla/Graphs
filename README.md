# Graph Implementations
## Overview
This repository contains the following graph classes:
- **ALGraph**: A graph implemented with an adjacency list.
- **AMGraph**: A graph implemented with an adjacency matrix.
Each graph class contains functions to add vertices and edges, as well as traverse the graph with breadth first and depth first searches. These traversing functions check if two vertices are connected.
